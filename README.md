# Pong-Game

## Description

This is our final project as a part of the course *Introduction to Computer Science and Programming* at the University of Lucerne. Together with my collaborator [FrederikBlmel](https://github.com/FrederikBlmel), we created a new exciting version of the classic game pong. The goal was to create the game from scratch and extend it beyond well known mechanics, applying the knowledge we retrieved in the course during the semester. The game is written in python and utilizes modules, functions and object oriented programming to provide a smooth gaming experience. It was a great and educational experience with a lot of challenges which had to be overcome especially considering that we had only little to almost no experience with programming in python before this course. This is why we are all the more proud of our final product and we hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we do.

## How to play the game

The following instructions show you how to run the game on your local computer. I worked with a separate virtual environment on this project. If you would like to do the same make sure to activate your environment first. It is no requirement however. Make sure to run the game with Python 3.

**1. Clone repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/FStiffler/Pong-Game.git
```
or using SSH

```
git clone git@github.com:FStiffler/Pong-Game.git
```

**2. Install requirements**

 Move to cloned repository directory and use the following command:

 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

 **3. Start game**

 Move to subdirectory `pong_game` and use the following command:

 ```
 python pong_game.py
 ```

You can, of course, also run the game using any IDE you like.

**4. Have fun playing**
