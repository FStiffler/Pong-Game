# Project Report

## Introduction

### What is program about?

### Where is it used?

### Why is it important?

### Overview of the rest of the report

## Background

### What other people did or had to say

* be sure to cite your references
  * Take list of project specification

### Problems and shortcomings of their work

- Basic Game
- Wanted to extend beyond that

### How your work is different and/or better

### Any relevant and specific information

## Project

### Your approach to the problem

- Work with modules, classes and functions
- Abstraction and decompostion
- Object oriented Programming

### What you did

### Design

* What you already had (and where it came from)
  * Started from scratch but looked a online [tutorial](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) and already existing [project](https://gist.github.com/vinothpandian/4337527) for some idea.

- What you added/changed

### Include drawings, screenshots, plots, ...

### What did work?

- Abstraction, Decomposition, Object oriented programming
- Game flow with clear logic

### What didn't work?

- Was not able to implement a proper game menu with interactive buttons
- Was not able to work with global variables  --> a lot of inputs and output per functions
- Struggled to implement ball cooldown phase

### Include graphs, equations, pictures, etc. as appropriate

### Results

## Conclusion

### What was accomplished / learned?

- Trial and error. Tried to apply knowledge from course and find logical solutions to problems

### Is there something you would do differently next time?

- Start with a frame work including a menu first and then start building the game within that framework
- Rely even more on classes (game and menu as classes with methods to play the game) similar to what is done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5JWrd7Y_14&ab_channel=CDcodes)

*Note:*
The links above lead to the raw data files. Some sound effects had to be extracted and altered to fit our needs. The software which was used for this cause was [Audiotonic](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/audiotonic-audio-editor-recorder-based-on-audacity/9n66vbrr4dpl?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
